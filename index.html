                        <p>Martin Margiela started his eponymous label in 1988. having previously graduated from
                            Antwerp's Academy of Fine Arts and worked for Jean Paul Gaultier. He is notoriously private,
                            refusing to have his photograph taken and always remaining backstage after shows.</p>
                        <p>Jenny and Martin met in 1983, when the competition was on the jury of the textile industry
                            Golden Spindle Award, and Martin was a participant in it. The prize was received by Dirk van
                            Sen, a member of the Antwerp Six, but Jenny convinced everyone else to the last that it was
                            Martin Margiela who deserved the victory.</p>

                        <p>Fusing the two genders, the House takes a cerebral approach to deconstructing, reinventing and redefining men's and womenswear silhouettes. Margiela's uncompromising approach to its iconoclast heritage is cast through Galliano's poetic vision of Haute Couture, marrying conceptualism with artistry, mystery with modern elegance. innovative, unique and daring. Our goal, in the words of Renzo Rosso, is to build not the biggest, but the most alternative fashion group.</p>
